Aerobic exercise tracker
Studies show 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week drastically improves health
Allow users to log their aerobic activity and create a motivating visual as they get closer to their goal (a plant/tree growing, a character reaching a destination, a coral reef getting healthier - you could let them select components at certain milestones like which fish they want to add etc)
